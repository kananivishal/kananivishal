### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate software developer currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)**. I specialize in **Android development** using Java and Firebase and love building real-world applications that combine clean UI, collaboration, and practical utility.

I’ve worked on several meaningful projects like:

- 📒 **NoteMaster** – A real-time collaborative note-taking app with Firebase
- 🌍 **Population Data Analysis** – Visual data trends on global population growth
- 💡 **Trash2Points** – A reward-based garbage-spotting app concept (Coming Soon)

I believe in building apps that not only work great but also **serve a purpose** in real life.
