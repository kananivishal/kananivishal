### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** at Marwadi University, Rajkot. I enjoy building Android and web applications using technologies like **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Firebase**, **MySQL**, and **PHP**.

Through my academic journey, I’ve developed several real-world projects, such as:

- 📱 **NoteMaster** – A collaborative note-taking app using Firebase and Java
- 🛒 **The ShoesBox** – An e-commerce Android app built with Kotlin and MySQL (via PHP API)
- 🖥️ **NotePlus** – A web-based note app with HTML/CSS/JS and PHP backend

I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-life problems, and I continue to learn and grow as I work on new challenges. My goal is to become a skilled IT professional with strong development and problem-solving abilities.
